Hello, I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at TMU's [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://sajad-saeedi.ca/team/), where I focus on task allocation in Multi-Robot systems. These systems are becoming increasingly common in various industries such as logistics, manufacturing, mining, and more. My research aims to develop effective task allocation methods leveraging AI/ML, especially under uncertain conditions and with limited communication. Additionally, I'm also involved in research on AI based microplastic detection in water bodies.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a Research Intern at the Robotics and Computer Vision Lab. During this tenure, I spearheaded a team of researchers in conceptualizing and constructing mobile robots designed for disinfection, aiming to combat the spread of infections, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic

I earned my Masterâ€™s of Engineering degree with a specialization in autonomous robotics from the University of Toronto Institute of Aerospace Studies (2018-2022). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Mechatronics at Thapar University. [CV](https://ishaanmht.github.io/files/Mehta_Ishaan_CV.pdf)

Volunteer Work
======
I'm an active volunteer with the Art of Living Foundation, dedicated to promoting breathwork and meditation for stress relief and inner peace. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I initiated daily virtual sessions offering free breathwork and meditation to help individuals combat stress and exhaustion. [Here is some research about the impact of breathwork on stress and wellness.](https://news.yale.edu/2020/07/27/improve-students-mental-health-yale-study-finds-teach-them-breathe?fbclid=IwAR0vZ5zRwuY6jZ7tGrLSy3U2gOhCYi1xAMj6d-oF-_g9mOW8Kn19Bb0M_W0)

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, guidance for aspiring researchers, or to learn more about breathwork.
