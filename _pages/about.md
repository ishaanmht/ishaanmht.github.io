Hello! I’m **Ishaan Mehta**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at [Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)](https://www.torontomu.ca/), working at the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab (RCVL)](https://sajad-saeedi.ca/team/).  
My research focuses on **planning and task allocation in multi-robot systems** designed for **service-oriented applications** — such as logistics, manufacturing, and facility management — where fleets of robots must collaborate efficiently and adapt to changing environments.

I have **8+ years of experience developing autonomous robotic systems**, including drones, self-driving cars, ground robots, and robotic manipulators, with a focus on **planning, perception, SLAM, and multi-robot coordination**.  
My work combines **optimization and deep learning**, particularly reinforcement learning and generative models, to develop scalable solutions for **robot decision-making** and **environment modeling**.

My broader research spans:
- **Multi-robot task allocation and distributed planning**
- **Dense SLAM, Gaussian Splatting, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)** for 3D scene understanding  
- **Manipulation and motion planning** for intelligent robot behaviors  
- **Deep reinforcement learning** for vision and planning tasks  

Over the course of my academic journey, I’ve contributed to **11+ publications** (including under review) in top-tier robotics and AI venues.  
I have collaborated with **20+ researchers** across academia and industry, led research teams, and mentored students in robotics and AI. My work emphasizes **bridging theoretical advances with practical implementation**, through **prototyping**, **experimental validation**, and **commercialization initiatives**.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a **Research Intern** at the RCVL Lab, where I led a team in designing and developing **UV-disinfection mobile robots** to combat infection spread during the COVID-19 pandemic — a project that strengthened my passion for applying robotics to real-world societal challenges.

I earned my **Master of Engineering in Autonomous Robotics** from the **University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS)**, where I worked on robotic perception and control.  
Before that, I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics** from **Thapar University**, India.

Volunteer Work
======
I'm an active volunteer with the Art of Living Foundation, dedicated to promoting breathwork and meditation for stress relief and inner peace. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I initiated daily virtual sessions offering free breathwork and meditation to help individuals combat stress and exhaustion. Further, I actively engage with SKY Campus Canada to promote well being in student community through breathwork and meditation. [Here is some research about the impact of breathwork on stress and wellness.](https://news.yale.edu/2020/07/27/improve-students-mental-health-yale-study-finds-teach-them-breathe?fbclid=IwAR0vZ5zRwuY6jZ7tGrLSy3U2gOhCYi1xAMj6d-oF-_g9mOW8Kn19Bb0M_W0)
