collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-08-20-CASE-2022
excerpt: 'This work introduces PA-Net, a novel neural network approach for approximating the Pareto front in the bi-objective travelling salesperson problem (BTSP) using reinforcement learning. By training on constrained optimization via Lagrangian relaxation and policy gradient, PA-Net outperforms existing methods with a 2.3% improvement in hypervolume metric and 4.5Ã— faster inference time. Application to robotic navigation tasks showcases its efficacy in optimal visiting order determination.'
