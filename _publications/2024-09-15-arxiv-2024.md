excerpt: 'This paper introduces M^3RS, a novel framework for time-bound multi-robot, multi-objective routing and scheduling missions with multiple task execution modes. It optimally assigns task sequences and execution modes to each agent based on user-defined criteria, addressing the trade-offs inherent in multi-robot applications. Utilizing a mixed-integer linear programming model and efficient column generation scheme, M^3RS is applied to the task of multi-robot disinfection in public spaces. Experiments highlight the advantages of multiple modes over fixed execution modes, demonstrating flexibility and improved performance in joint metrics.'
